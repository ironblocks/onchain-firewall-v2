# Operators

## Overview

Operators are the backbone of the Venn network, responsible for validating transactions offchain. They play a crucial role in maintaining network security and efficiency while being encouraged through the fee management system.

## Core Components

### 1. Operator Registry

The Operator Registry serves as the central management system for all operator-related operations. It provides the following functionality:

- **Registration Management**

  - Operator onboarding and offboarding
  - Status tracking and verification
  - Access control and permissions

- **Subscription System**
  - Operator-to-operator subscription management
  - Relationship tracking between operators

## Prerequisites

Before becoming a Venn network operator, you must:

1. Be registered as an operator on dependent protocols

## Registration Process

### Network Registration

1. Contact the Venn admin team
2. Submit required documentation and credentials
3. Complete the registration process through the Operator Registry

### Subnet Access

## Subscription System

The subscription system enables operators to:

## Rewards and Incentives

Operators are compensated through the fee management system:

- **Fee Distribution**

  - Automatic distribution through smart contracts
  - Operators should be able to claim their rewards using dependency contracts
